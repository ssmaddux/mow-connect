In this application I want to connect customers with companies in a user friendly way. Have you ever recieved a busnes card from a small lawncare or landscaping company and use them for an ammount of time and lose contact over winter? Or the opposite as a company, are you always looking for customers or writing names and numbers on paper or in an excell sheet? If so we have a solution! In our webpage we hold information and give it to our users so you never have to look for cutomers or lawmcare companies again!
